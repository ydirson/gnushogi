    Ken'ichi Nakayama has created alternative bitmaps for
    promoted rook and promoted bishop. He claims that these
    icons are more readable for japanese people. The bitmaps
    are introduced using the --with-top-part-bitmaps option.

    Paul Reines has created a set of pieces with more chess-like
    graphics, so that it may easier to learn how to play shogi.
    These pieces can be chosen instead of the japanese pieces
    by using the -DWESTERN_BITMAPS options in the Makefile.
    The postscript file western_moves.ps shows the possible moves
    using these icons.
    [NOTE: this postscript file has since been removed.  The western
    bitmaps are now always available.]
