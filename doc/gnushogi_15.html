<H2> 2.2 Sample game </H2>
<!--docid::SEC15::-->
<P>

This game was annotated by Pieter Stouten (see section <A HREF="gnushogi_21.html#SEC21">5. References and links</A>).  I have made some minor corrections.  Note that captures are
denoted by the "x" symbol e.g. Rx3f and drops are denoted by the "*"
symbol e.g. R*3f.  Check is indicated by a "+" after the move,
e.g. R3f+.  I recommend you use gnushogi/xshogi to play along with this
game.  In xshogi simply hit the "Force Moves" button after starting
up, while in gnushogi enter the word "force" at the prompt.  This will
allow you to enter moves for both sides.
</P><P>

Note also that the move numbering system used here is the chess-type
system where one move means one move by each player.  The Japanese count
one move made by each player as two moves.
</P><P>

Below you will find (the English translation of) an annotated game which
was published in the Dutch Shogi magazine "81" and in the Dutch
beginners booklet.  It has proven to be a very useful game to explain
some basic principles of Shogi.  Also, it is a rather straightforward
game compared to professional games where in most cases very diffuse
middle game fights take place.

Black: Michael Trent (1-dan).  White: David Murphy (2-dan).
</P><P>

   1. P2f P3d  2. P2e B3c <BR>
[ This move is necessary, as otherwise white can exchange pawns: 3. P2d
Px2d 4. Rx2d.  He would thus get a pawn in hand and open up his rook
file. ]
</P><P>

   3. P7f P4d <BR>
[ White closes the bishop diagonal again.  He plans to play ranging rook
(the rook goes to 5b, 4b, 3 or 2b; a defensive strategy) and in that
case he'd better avoid an exchange of bishops.  One of the reasons is
that he will have problems developing his pieces without leaving holes
for bishop drops. ]
</P><P>

   4. S4h R3b  5. P3f S4b  6. K6h K6b <BR>
[ In general the rook plays an important role in the attacks.  It is
wise to move the king away from the area where the initial fights will
be and both players act according to the Shogi proverb "keep the rook
and king apart". ]
</P><P>

   7. K7h K7b  8. P5f P5d  9. G4i-5h G4a-5b <BR>
[ Both players use their second gold general to build their castle. ]
</P><P>

   10. S6h <BR>
[ In itself this move is not bad.  However, it will become clear that
black plans a quick attack and in that case it is wiser to omit this
move. ]
</P><P>

   10... S5c  11. P1f P1d <BR>
[ The advance of the edge pawns must be timed very well.  The remark at
black's tenth move applies here too: this move is good if black wants to
play a slow game, because it eliminates a future B1e. ]
</P><P>

   12. P4f K8b  13. N3g S7b <BR>
[ Black develops his knight in order to start an attack over the second,
third and fourth files.  White strengthens his king's position and
awaits the attack.  He aims at a counterattack as soon as black has
broken through into the white camp.  Probably white's breakthrough will
take place later, but he has good compensation in the form of a stronger
castle.  This theme occurs very often in static rook versus ranging rook
games. ]
</P><P>

   14. P4e R4b <BR>
[ Black starts his attack and white puts up a very passive defence.  His
rook has a hard task now to penetrate the black position.  Moreover, he
blocks his own bishop.  It seems much better to start a counterattack
with 14... P3e, later to be followed by B2b, B5a or Bx4d in order to use
his rook more actively. ]
</P><P>

   15. Px4d Sx4d  16. P*4e S5c <BR>
[ 16... Sx4e is more active.  A silver general is normally more valuable
than a knight, but white gets two pawns in hand and black none, while
the knight might come in handy for white too. ]
</P><P>

   17. Bx3c+ Nx3c  18. P2d Px2d <BR>
[ Black threatens to break through and white has to consider taking the
pawn on 2d or starting a counterattack with Nx4e.  If he chooses the
latter, black can play Px2c+ followed by +P3c.  The disadvantage is the
black "tokin" (=promoted pawn) that white will get in his camp; the
advantage is that it will cost black two more moves to promote his rook.
Because white did not trust that the result after engaging in a
"semeai" (=mutual attack) with 18...Nx4e would give a positive result,
he captured the pawn on 2d.  Making the right decision in moments like
this often makes the difference between a win and a loss: miss one
attacking chance and you will be forced to defend the whole game until
the unavoidable defeat; on the other hand, an unsound attack can destroy
all "aji" (=potential, meaning possibilities, threats) without getting
anything in return. ]
</P><P>

   19. Rx2d Nx4e  20. Nx4e Rx4e  21. R2a+ P*4g <BR>
[ Now it becomes clear why black's 10. S6h was not good.  Had this move
been omitted, then white would not have had the time to play 13... S7b
and after R2a+ the gold on 6a would hang.  Thus black would have kept
"sente" (=initiative).  Instead of 21... P*4g, B*6d is a very good
move, because after 22. P*2h black does not have a pawn in hand anymore
and he is being threatened with the annoying 22... N*4f 23. G5g N3h+
24. S4g +N4h also.  Black can also counter 21... B*6d with 22. N*3g.
White would then reply with 22... R4b 23. B*3c P*4g 24. Bx4b+ Sx4b.  The
white rook has played its role and instead of spending moves on saving
it white starts to scatter black's defences by successive pawn drops on
the fourth file: 25. Gx4g P*4f 26. G5g N*6e 27. G5h P4g+ 28. Gx4g P*4f.
This analysis was provided by Kato Hifumi, 9-dan professional (the
highest regular grade).  Destroying the coherence of the enemy pieces
(their shape) by dropping pawns is one of the most important Shogi
techniques.  With the actual move 21... P*4g white missed a good
chance. ]
</P><P>

   22. Sx4g P*4f  23. B*3g Px4g+  24. +Rx6a +Px3g <BR>
[ 23. B*3g seems pointless, but a closer look reveals that it is
actually quite mean.  On move 24 white cannot capture black's "Ryu"
(=dragon =promoted rook) with his silver: 24... Sx6a 25. N*7d K7b
26. G*8b mate.  By attacking the front of the white castle and
threatening to mate him there, black has the chance to break down the
white defences from the side. ]
</P><P>

   25. +Rx5b S*6b <BR>
[ Here 25... B*4d would be much better, because it is defensive and
attacking at the same time.  After e.g. 26. G*4c Bx9i+ 27. Gx5c black
threatens 28. +Rx7b Kx7b 29. S*6a K8b 30. S*7a Kx7a 31. G*7b mate.
White is one move quicker, however.  He has the following beautiful
"tsume" (mating sequence where every move is check): 27... N*8f 28. Px8f
S*8g 29. Kx8g B*9h 30. K7h Bx8i+ 31. K8g +B8i-8h 32. K9f L*9e mate.
This illustrates the sharpness of Shogi: one move can make the
difference between winning and losing. ]
</P><P>

   26. P*4f Rx4f <BR>
[ This move eliminates white's last chances.  26... R4b 27. +Rx4b Sx4b
28. R*4a seems annoying, but after 28... B*3c 29. S7g B*3b white wins
the rook and with his "tokin" on 3g there still is some hope. ]
</P><P>

   27. N*6e +P4g <BR>
[ White cannot defend anymore, so he starts a desperate attack.  Black
does not lose the right track, however. ]
</P><P>

   28. Nx5c+ +Px5h  29. +Nx6b +Px6h  30. Gx6h N*8f  31. Px8f B*6i  32. Gx6i
   R4h+  33. N*6h +Rx6h  34. Gx6h S*8g  35. Kx8g N*9e  36. K7h Resigns <BR>
[ White resigns here, because after 36... B*8g 27. K7g his attack has
petered out. ]
