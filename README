GNU Shogi, release 1.4.2
------------------------

This is release 1.4.2 of GNU shogi, a program which plays shogi
(Japanese chess), as well as xshogi, the graphical interface to GNU
shogi.

GNU shogi and xshogi were originally written by Matthias Mutz
<mutz@fmi.uni-passau.de>, have been maintained by Mike Vanier
<mvanier@bbb.caltech.edu> in the 1.3.x era, by Luis Felipe Strano
Moraes <luis.strano@gmail.com> until 1.4.0, and are now maintained by
Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>. GNU shogi was in turn based on GNU
Chess 4.0, i.e. the first version of GNU Shogi was obtained by
"simply" modifying the chess-specific parts of GNU Chess 4.0.  We
would like to thank the authors of GNU Chess 4.0 for making the
sources of that program available.

See the file NEWS for the new features of this release.

For the installation procedure read the file "INSTALL".  For more information
on shogi please look at the files in the doc directory or read the info file.

The project is maintained at https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnushogi/
where you will find pointers to the bug tracker, mailing lists, git
repository for the source code, etc.

The prefered way to contribute patches is through "git send-email" to
the gnushogi-devel mailing-list.  You may also wish to publish them in
a public repository; the repo.or.cz Free-Software-based platform
allows you to do that easily, as a fork of
http://repo.or.cz/w/gnushogi.git.
